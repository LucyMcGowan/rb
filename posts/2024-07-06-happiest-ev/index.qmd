We are prepping for our first family road trip in the Rivian and we just welcomed the newest member of our family four weeks ago. We are a SNOO family, we love Harvey Karp and we LOVE our SNOO, so we *will* be finding a way to squeeze it into the car for this trip. When trying to decide between the stroller and the SNOO, the SNOO definitely wins. In fact, I would ditch my suitcase and just wear all of my travel clothes Ryanair style in favor of the SNOO.

Good news, dear readers, we actually didn't have to decide between the stroller and the SNOO, a few days after this post we figured out we can stick the stroller in the frunk! Check out the details [in this post](/posts/2024-07-10-uppa-baby-venn-diagram/index.html).

For those without infants, or perhaps with infants who sleep better than ours, [the SNOO](https://www.happiestbaby.com/products/snoo-smart-bassinet) is a little rocking robot that soothes your baby to sleep. We've used it for all three babies and *love* it.

After some testing, we have concluded the best place for the beloved SNOO is in the trunk. Here's how we did it:

1. We opened the spare tire compartment (we don't have a spare tire but if we did, again, would absolutely choose the SNOO over a tire) and removed the contents
1. Patrick and my suitcase went in here (we had one large suitcase)
1. We removed the legs on the SNOO and stuck those inside it
1. SNOO went on top of the suitcase, and duffle bag with the kids clothes went inside along with the SNOO legs

VoilÃ ! ðŸ¥³
