We made it to Richmond last night, onwards to D.C.! I added a post mortem from the ride to here to the [part one post](/posts/2024-07-11-dc-part-1), tl;dr it went great, only tricky part is timing bathroom breaks, totally doable to coincide biological breaks with charging stations for adults but not so simple when it comes to recently potty trained little ones. 

## The Plan

The plan for today is to make the treck up 95. We attached our E-ZPass but unfortunately the Express Lane is only open northbound until 10am, which would both require an ambitious start time and would get us to D.C. several hours before our early check-in time. We plan to have Patrick pop over to a charger by a local Walmart in the morning and then hit the road around 11:30am. Since we expect to hit traffic on the way up, we have some
alternate routes in our back pocket. 

## The Drive

We've got a full charge and only 115 miles to drive, so no range anxiety here! Plan A is to take 95 straight to D.C., Plan B will take us on 301 -- the scenic route!
