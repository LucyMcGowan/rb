We all love our UPPAbaby Vistas; many of our adventures would not be half as fun (or practical) without it! [In my last post](/posts/2024-07-06-happiest-ev/index.html) we were working out how to squeeze the SNOO in and decided we would prioritize sleep over family walking speed, but it turns out we can have both! Sometimes moms really **CAN** have it all!!

As we were planning our upcoming trip to D.C., Patrick and I came across a post somewhere that said something to the effect of "the venn diagram of Rivian and UPPAbaby Vista owners is a circle." HA! I can't find the original post but if I do I'll link it here.

We have the [Vista V2 double stroller](https://uppababy.com/strollers/full-size/vista-v2/jake/) and YES it fits. We have found the best way to bring it is to take the back wheels off and stick it in the frunk!

To remove the wheels, press the button in the center and pull. Be sure to remove your fingers from the area between the wheel and the stroller, this is a prime pinching zone (ask me how I know 😑)

The stroller body, both seats, and removed back wheels all comfortably fit in here. Happy adventuring!
