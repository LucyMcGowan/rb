Here we go! First full family road trip! We're heading to Washington D.C. for a wedding. Roll call: we’ve got mom driving (👋), dad riding shotgun (or sometimes in the middle to pacify baby), and two big sisters in the back back.  

## The plan

We’re staring the day with a full charge ⚡️, first time we’ve had it at 100%! We’re planning to just drive to Richmond today and tackle the DC traffic well rested tomorrow. Hoping to leave mid-morning, but we will see! The Rivian is mostly packed, so seems doable! 

## The packing

This is a 4-night trip. We've got:

✅ One large suitcase with clothes for mom, dad, and baby along with some other baby essentials like diapers and extra swaddles in the trunk
✅ One duffle bag with clothes and shoes for the big sisters in the trunk
✅ Three carseats -- rear-facing infant carseat in the middle, two full size forward facing carseats in the way back
✅ Two iPads
✅ [UPPAbaby Vista double stroller](/posts/2024-06-10-uppa-baby-venn-diagram/) in the frunk
✅ [SNOO](/posts/2024-06-06-happiest-ev/) in the trunk
✅ One tuxedo for dad and two dresses for mom laid on top of the bags in the trunk
✅ Three kids, two parents
✅ An adventurous spirit and a full charge!

## Map it out

It turns out if we charge up to 100% (which we have!) and put the car in converve mode it predicts we can go straight there with no stops -- nice!

We are going to need to stop after two hours anyways so I can breastfeed the baby, so we opted for All-Purpose mode and a stop. We set the filter in the Rivian app to only suggest Rivian adventure network charging spots that are fast. By default, Rivian picked a stop in Henderson. A bit of research shows there is a Starbucks right next to the charging stations (perfect for a mama recharge while Rivian gets a boost, and hopefully some clean bathrooms 🤞)
