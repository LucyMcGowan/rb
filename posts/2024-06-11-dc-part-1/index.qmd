Here we go! First full family road trip! We're heading to Washington D.C. for a wedding. Roll call: we‚Äôve got mom driving (üëã), dad riding shotgun (or sometimes in the middle to pacify baby), and two big sisters in the back back.  

## The plan

We‚Äôre staring the day with a full charge ‚ö°Ô∏è, first time we‚Äôve had it at 100%! We‚Äôre planning to just drive to Richmond today and tackle the DC traffic well rested tomorrow. Hoping to leave mid-morning, but we will see! The Rivian is mostly packed, so seems doable! 

## Map it out

It turns out if we charge up to 100% (which we have!) and put the car in converve mode it predicts we can go straight there with no stops -- nice!

We are going to need to stop after two hours anyways so I can breastfeed the baby, so we opted for All-Purpose mode and a stop. We set the filter in the Rivian app to only suggest Rivian adventure network charging spots that are fast. By default, Rivian picked a stop in Henderson. A bit of research shows there is a Starbucks right next to the charging stations (perfect for a mama recharge while Rivian gets a boost, and hopefully some clean bathrooms ü§û)
