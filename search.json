    "text": "The decision\nHow did we decide on a Rivian? Three factors:\n\nI woke up in a panic a few nights ago realizing that our third baby, due in June, will add a third full-size carseat to our car, something our current cars cannot easily fit\nFour days ago, Rivian added North Carolina to the list of states eligible to lease\nPatrick thinks Rivians are cool\n\nLet‚Äôs talk about #1 first. Our family car is a Ford Explorer. I love it for the two girls, we have their carseats in the middle row, but it definitely cannot fit three carseats across unless one is a booster and our eldest is around 10 pounds away from being big enough for a booster seat, so it may be a while before that is a viable option. We could put one carseat in the third row, but it looks like if we do that someone will have to always climb in the trunk. This is ok, but not ideal, in my middle of the night panic, I am imagining trying to wrangle three kids in a busy parking lot and this configuration, while certainly doable, does not seem convinient. I am about to have more babies than hands! If we can make life more convineint I am all for it.\nWe started researching carseats in a Rivian, I quickly found this facebook post from a few years ago ‚Äì look at those cute kids! Three in a row, all looking so happy!\n\n\nOk, a friend pointed out to me that the middle kid here may actaully be in a booster seat, so this picture itself doesn‚Äôt prove that the Rivian can solve my problems, but there is definitely more room than the Ford Escape back there! And those carseats on the ends look big, cupholders and everything!\n\n\n\n\n\nOn to #2. Patrick received an email 4 days ago that North Carolina was added to the list for leasing. Here is why we would we prefer a lease:\n\nThere is a $7500 tax credit for new electric vehicles purchased after 2023. Purchasing a new Rivian does not qualify for the tax credit because they are too expensive. But there is a ‚Äúleasing loophole‚Äù. It turns out with a lease the lender gets the tax credit (and the rules are different since this is a commerical transaction) and they can opt to pass the savings on to the lessees (us!), which is what Rivian is doing.\nPatrick is totally hyped about the Rivian, but I am a bit more risk adverse when it comes to being an early adopter (I knowwww we aren‚Äôt that early when it comes to electric vehicles, but the average person doesn‚Äôt have one! And this company feels new!). Leasing feels like a safer option to me. Also, with a car like a Rivian with so much tech changing so rapidly, I was worried if we purchased an early model we‚Äôd be dissappointed in a few years when everything was improved.\nWe did some #rivianmath. We decided that we were going to trade in our Ford Explorer ‚Äì we have a monthly payment on this car until next December. With the tax credit and trade-in, we were able to get our montly payment for the Rivian down to less than what we are paying for Explorer, so I know we can fit it in the budget. Why is this Rivian math? Well, obviously even though we will be paying less per month for the Rivian, if we had kept the Ford Explorer we would own it after our payments, with the Rivian we are basically just lighting money on fire and then we have to give it back (jk, we are getting to drive a beautiful vehicle for three years and my babies will be able to all fit comfortably! No one will get squished in a parking lot trying to climb into a trunk!) Like I said, this is #rivianmath, but it did make the sign up easier knowing that our budget coudl already fit this.\n\n#3 is perhaps self-evident ‚Äì Patrick thinks the Rivians are cool! He‚Äôs probably right, he usually is. So there you have it! We‚Äôll post updates as they come."

In my last post we were working out how to squeeze the SNOO in and decided we would prioritize sleep over family walking speed, but it turns out we can have both! Sometimes moms really CAN have it all!!\n\n\nAs we were planning our upcoming trip to D.C., Patrick and I came across a post somewhere that said something to the effect of ‚Äúthe venn diagram of Rivian and UPPAbaby Vista owners is a circle.‚Äù HA! I can‚Äôt find the original post but if I do I‚Äôll link it here.\nWe have the Vista V2 double stroller and YES it fits. We have found the best way to bring it is to take the back wheels off and stick it in the frunk!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nTo remove the wheels, press the button in the center and pull. Be sure to remove your fingers from the area between the wheel and the stroller, this is a prime pinching zone (ask me how I know üòë)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur stroller in one of our favorite places\n\n\n\nThe stroller body, both seats, and removed back wheels all comfortably fit in here.

We set the filter in the Rivian app to only suggest Rivian adventure network charging spots that are fast. By default, Rivian picked a stop in Henderson. A bit of research shows there is a Starbucks right next to the charging stations (perfect for a mama recharge while Rivian gets a boost, and hopefully some clean bathrooms ü§û)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOff we go!

We got a later start than planned due to a last minute doc visit but were still in Richmond before dinner. The stop was lovely and as predicted the Starbucks offered some much needed caffiene and a clean bathroom! We were the only vehicle at the charging station (phew! I had some last minute range anxiety when I realized I hadn‚Äôt checked beforehand how often the spots were all filled! This can be seen in the Rivian app so I‚Äôve added that to my pre-planning checklist!) and it charged very fast! Only hiccup ‚Äì both girls declared they desperately needed a bathroom when we were about twenty minutes from the stop ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è, so we ended up having to pull off at gas station, bleh! While there defintely are plenty of charging places along the route, unfortunately (or maybe fortunately since it saved us from christening our lovely back back) gas stations are way more ubiquitous.
